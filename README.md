  My name is Adam Nelson and I am learning about computer science, programming, and specifically all things related to making video games. It is a vast and complex world once getting get down to the details of almost any subject that can be thought of. This is part of the reason we may be optimistic about the path we have chosen at first but later find ourselves feeling lost and overwhelmed by the complexities and details that we only came to know later down the path. The important thing in these kind of situations is to not be too scared to no longer move forward. To choose just one thing even if it may be off a whim and start moving forward. 
  I had a friend once who told me something along the lines of, "Look up and the stars and just choose one.". Thinking about this lead me to realize that I, in fact no person, can get anywhere without taking some sort of action. In order to take action we have to stop thinking, choose something, and simply start going towards it. I personally still struggle with choosing one thing and just sticking to it out of the fear that it may not be the thing I will want in future. Sitting here even thinking about this now I am not sure where this fear stems from. My belief and faith in myself and even humanity itself has been crushed over the years. When you get hurt bad enough and too many times you lose faith in the world; You lose faith in life. Especially when you are young and don't have any guidance.
